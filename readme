1) Collecting tweets of all globally trending topics:
	- Set up a mongo server on localhost:28888
	- Run java -jar TweetCollector.jar for as long as desired. 

	This will produce 2 collections called trends and tweets in mongodb in a db called 'twitter_mini'
	In our case we collected approximately 40gb of tweets, within a span for 4 days coinciding with the Super Bowl in US.


2) Group by user:
	- Run TweetAnalytics.jar
	- Choose the first option  (This is a lengthy process)

	This will produce a collection named 'users' which contains basic info regarding the user.


3) Generate basic analytics
	- Run TweetAnalytics.jar
	- Choose the second option

	The result will be added fields to the 'users' documents.
	The analytical process is partly completed during the grouping pipeline, as in incurs practically no extra cost.
	Also during this step the number of a trends a user appears in will be counted.


4) Calculate quartiles
	- Run TweetAnalytics.jar
	- Choose the third option

	Calculated the quartiles and the median of the user collection by frequency.
	Sadly with our data the values we got were 1, 1, 2..Perhaps a mean value instead of a median would produce better results.
	There seemed to be noticeable number of spammers which we noticed from the content of their messages. But a random sample
	of 40 users among 880k didn't capture such representatives.

5) Choose 10 users per quartile and track them
	- Run TweetAnalytics.jar
	- Choose the fourth option
